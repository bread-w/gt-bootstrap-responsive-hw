                    Hello there, and thanks for stopping by! My name is Brad
                    Williams and I was born and raised right here in Atlanta,
                    Ga. I graduated from high school in 2008, where I then went
                    on to study Spanish at Auburn University. War Eagle! After
                    graduation, I taught Spanish for 2 years in Atlanta, and
                    then picked up my things and moved a few thousand miles
                    south to Santiago, Chile! While in Chile, I taught English
                    to both children and adults, improving both my Spanish
                    language skills and broadening my cultural perspective.
                    While it was at times jarring, I loved my time in Chile, the
                    people I met and the experiences I gained while living
                    there. After a year, I decided to head back to the U.S.
                    where I would go on to work for Teach for America in Denver,
                    Colorado. In Denver, I taught math in an English as a second
                    language classroom to first generation hispanic immigrants.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2017, I decided that I no longer wanted to pursue a
                    career in teaching, mainly because of the sheer lack of
                    financial growth available for most long term teachers. I
                    then moved back to Atlanta and began working at a coworking
                    startup, SharedSpace, at the peak of the coworking bubble. I
                    started as General Manager, and after bringing a space to
                    profitability, I then went on to open two more spaces, one
                    in Cobb County and another in Augusta, Ga. While working at
                    SharedSpace, I hosted a coding bootcamp, which sparked an
                    interest in coding that would stick with me until today. I
                    worked for SharedSpace for 2 years. While opening the
                    SharedSpace location in Augusta, I was approached about a
                    position with a startup concept called Kefi, which I decided
                    to follow, yet again bringing me back to Atlanta. At Kefi, I
                    was very quickly promoted to manager, but as is the nature
                    of startups, it came with its own set of challenges, and
                    ended up not being the place for me. Once covid-19 hit the
                    U.S., the signs were clear, and I decided to move on to
                    bigger and better things.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I’m now working full time as a student at the Georgia Tech
                    Coding bootcamp following my dream of becoming a developer.
                    While not coding, I love to play video games, cook, watch
                    movies, and spend time with my girlfriend and pets. I love
                    learning foreign languages and I speak spanish at an
                    advanced level, and I’m hoping to add a few coding languages
                    to my belt as well!
